                                <p>The company employs innovative analysis techniques to derive insights from all formats of
                                    data. Python, R and SQL are the core statistical computing software used by the company,
                                    but the team is versatile in other traditional statistical packages such as SPSS, Excel
                                    and STATA. R offers a rich and diverse range of statistical packages capable of
                                    producing customised output, especially visualisations while Python has been mainly used
                                    when the volume of data becomes huge. Both software also have the capability to handle
                                    spatial data and produce beautiful, interactive maps, although QGIS has remained the
                                    primary tool for this purpose. In a nutshell, the company has proven skills in:</p>
